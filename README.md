Implementing Grazing in Models of Catastrophic Shift (CAS01)
============================================================


Objective
This project aims to provide a new baseline model for grazing on cellular automata models. 


## Models

### Parent Model (KÃ©fi et al 2008)


### Livestock model


### Associative protection model

### combined


## Manuscript: "Grazing raises risk of catastrophic shifts"
A manuscript is in preparation [`manuscript/first draft/`]()
