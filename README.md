Towards a spatial resilience framework for arid rangelands (CAS02)
==================================================================

## Objective

The project is developing a spatially-explicit consumer-resource model, based on the pair-approximation developed in KÃ©fi et al 2007 TPB, extended by a functional response model and spatially explicit components of grazing.
This aims at an integration of spatial grazing mortality into a population-dynamics framework as developed by Noy-Meir 1975 and extended by van de Koppel et al 1997 and Rietkerk and van de Koppel 1997.
The model is of exploring how certain assumptions on global and local feed-backs, in combination with management practices affect the thresholds of catastrophic shifts.


### Deliverables

#### R-package 'livestock' 

A package to simulate and graphically visualise trajectories and attractors in a simple spatially-implicit model framework using pair-approximations. 

#### Manuscript: "Towards a spatial resilience framework for arid rangelands"

To be submitted to special issue in 'Ecological Indicators'. 

#### Interactive online model tool (Shiny)

A fully flexible simulation tool to visualise change of attractor with changing balance of global and local feed-backs.
