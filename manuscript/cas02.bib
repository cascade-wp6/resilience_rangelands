	abstract = {In this paper we present the R package {deSolve} to solve initial value problems {(IVP)} written as ordinary differential equations {(ODE)}, differential algebraic equations {(DAE)} of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations {(PDE)}, the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the {ODEPACK} package {(LSODE}, {LSODES}, {LSODA}, {LSODAR)}, {DVODE} and {DASPK2.0.} In addition, a suite of {Runge-Kutta} integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e.g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the benefits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R\~{A}{\textcent}\^{A}?\^{A}?s high-level procedures. {deSolve} is the successor of package odesolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the {GNU} General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have provided detail of the mechanisms by which plants and animals interact, but attempts to apply this knowledge to understand function at the scale of whole fields or grazed ecosystems can be fraught with difficulties. Faced with a plethora of detail, and yet demands to make models more comprehensive, modellers face pressure to revert to simplified accounts for what are assumed to be well-established biological phenomena, for example, for describing plant growth and intake, but this raises the risk that important insights may be lost, or that the analyses may face errors of scaling. The predictions of a previously described spatial model are compared with those of a non-spatial rendition of the same model to identify the differences in predictions and the sources of these differences. In particular, the use of the conventional empirical growth functions and their interaction with temporal and spatial scaling errors are examined. The comparison exposed how substantial errors could be made in predicting yield and stability under grazing. It is proposed that such errors might be avoided by ensuring that the functional responses used capture the insights of more detailed studies, and by recognizing the difficulties of scaling-up from the level of processes to the field scale and beyond.},

	abstract = {This article synthesizes the ecological concepts and perspectives underpinning the development and application of state-and-transition models, thresholds, and rangeland health. Introduction of the multiple stable state concept paved the way for the development of these alternative evaluation procedures by hypothesizing that multiple stable plant communities can potentially occupy individual ecological sites. Vegetation evaluation procedures must be able to assess continuous and reversible as well as discontinuous and nonreversible vegetation dynamics because both patterns occur and neither pattern alone provides a complete assessment of vegetation dynamics on all rangelands. Continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics prevail within stable vegetation states, whereas discontinuous and nonreversible dynamics occur when thresholds are surpassed and one stable state replaces another. State-and-transition models can accommodate both categories of vegetation dynamics because they represent vegetation change along several axes, including fire regimes, weather variability, and management prescriptions, in addition to the succession-grazing axis associated with the traditional range model. Ecological thresholds have become a focal point of state-and-transition models because threshold identification is necessary for recognition of the various stable plant communities than can potentially occupy an ecological site. Thresholds are difficult to define and quantify because they represent a complex series of interacting components, rather than discrete boundaries in time and space. Threshold components can be categorized broadly as structural and functional based on compositional and spatial vegetation attributes, and on modification of ecosystem processes, respectively. State-and-transition models and rangeland health procedures have developed in parallel, rather than as components of an integrated framework, because the two procedures primarily rely on structural and functional thresholds, respectively. It may be prudent for rangeland professionals to consider the introduction of these alternative evaluation procedures as the beginning of a long-term developmental process, rather than as an end point marked by the adoption of an alternative set of standardized evaluation procedures. /// Este art\'{i}culo sintetiza los conceptos ecol\'{o}gicos y perspectivas en las que se fundamenta el desarrollo y aplicaci\'{o}n de los modelos de estado- y- transici\'{o}n, umbrales y salud del pastizal. La introducci\'{o}n del concepto de m\'{u}ltiples estados estables estableci\'{o} el camino para el desarrollo de estos procedimientos alternativos de evaluaci\'{o}n, hipotetizando que m\'{u}ltiples comunidades estables de plantas puede potencialmente ocupar sitios ecol\'{o}gicos individuales. Los procedimientos de evaluaci\'{o}n de la vegetaci\'{o}n deben ser capaces de evaluar tanto las din\'{a}micas de vegetaci\'{o}n continuas y reversibles como las discontinuas y no reversibles, ya que ambos patrones ocurren y ning\'{u}n patr\'{o}n solo provee una evaluaci\'{o}n completa de las din\'{a}micas de la vegetaci\'{o}n en todos los pastizales. Las din\'{a}micas de la vegetaci\'{o}n continuas y reversibles prevalecen dentro de los estados estables de la vegetaci\'{o}n mientras que las discontinuas y no reversibles ocurren cuando los umbrales son sobrepasados y un estado estable remplaza a otro. Los modelos de estados- y- transici\'{o}n pueden acomodar ambas categor\'{i}as de din\'{a}micas de la vegetaci\'{o}n porque ellos representan el cambio de la vegetaci\'{o}n a lo largo de varios ejes, incluyendo reg\'{i}menes de fuego, variabilidad clim\'{a}tica y prescripciones de manejo; adem\'{a}s del eje de sucesi\'{o}n-apacentamiento asociado con el modelo tradicional del pastizal. Los umbrales ecol\'{o}gicos han venido a ser un punto central de los modelos de estado- y- transici\'{o}n, porque la identificaci\'{o}n de estos umbrales es necesaria para reconocer las diferentes comunidades vegetales estables que potencialmente pueden ocupar un sitio ecol\'{o}gico. Los umbrales son dif\'{i}ciles de definir y cuantificar porque ellos representan una serie compleja de componentes interactuando en lugar de fronteras discretas en tiempo y espacio. Los componentes de los umbrales pueden ser ampliamente categorizados como estructurales y funcionales en base a los atributos de composicionales y espaciales de la vegetaci\'{o}n y en la modificaci\'{o}n de los procesos de los ecosistemas respectivamente. Los modelos de estados y- transici\'{o}n y los procedimientos de salud del pastizal se han desarrollado paralelamente en lugar de desarrollarse como componentes de una estructura integrada porque los dos procedimientos se basan principalmente en umbrales estructurales y funcionales respectivamente. Pude ser prudente para la profesi\'{o}n de manejo de pastizales considerar la introducci\'{o}n de estas procedimientos alternativos de evaluaci\'{o}n como el inicio de un proceso de desarrollo a largo plazo, en lugar de un punto final marcado por la adopci\'{o}n de un grupo alternativo de procedimientos estandarizados de evaluaci\'{o}n.},

	abstract = {(1) Differences in plant species' abundances in response to cattle grazing and protection were measured across fences at fifteen sites in productive semi-natural mediterranean grasslands. The results were tested for the consistency of species' responses to grazing intensity and for their association with plant attributes expected to be involved in the grazing response. (2) Of the seventy-three most common species, forty-nine showed responses that were largely consistent over sites, being either significantly more abundant on the more protected side, significantly more abundant on the more grazed side, or not significantly different. The remaining twenty-four species were inconsistent, being significantly more abundant on the protected side in some sites and on the grazed side in others. (3) Of the inconsistent species, fourteen showed a pattern of responses over sites that could be explained by a unimodal response to grazing intensity, with an optimum at intensities between the extremes of complete protection and very heavy continuous grazing represented in the study. (4) Species response to grazing was not significantly associated with family, which inferred chemical palatability, nor with spininess. (5) Perennial species with long growing seasons were somewhat more frequent among protection increasers, and their total cover greater in protected grassland. (6) Grazing response was strongly and significantly associated with plant growth form: protection increasers were mostly tall erect plants; grazing increasers mostly small, prostrate or rosette plants; and species with intermediate response mostly erect plants of medium height. (7) Ungrazed grassland was dominated (60-80\% cover) by tall perennials and tall, annual grasses. Under light to moderate grazing their cover decreased to the benefit of annuals of a wide range of growth forms and families; of those, under heavy grazing, small and prostrate annuals, rosette crucifers and thistles remained abundant. (8) The observed responses to grazing from none to light and moderate intensity can be explained best by the opening of establishment gaps in the closed sward of foliage and mulch maintained by the dominants. At moderate to heavy grazing the vertical differential defoliation gradient imposed by cattle, particularly early in the growing season, becomes the major mechanism of grassland change.*},

	abstract = {Heightening human impacts on the Earth result in widespread losses of production and conservation values and make large-scale ecosystem restoration increasingly urgent. Tackling this problem requires the development of general guiding principles for restoration so that we can move away from the ad hoc, site- and situation-specific approach that now prevails. A continuum of restoration efforts can be recognized, ranging from restoration of localized highly degraded sites to restoration of entire landscapes for production and/or conservation reasons. We emphasize the importance of developing restoration methodologies that are applicable at the landscape scale. Key processes in restoration include identifying and dealing with the processes leading to degradation in the first place, determining realistic goals and measures of success, developing methods for implementing the goals and incorporating them into land-management and planning strategies, and monitoring the restoration and assessing its success. Few of these procedures are currently incorporated in many restoration projects. The concept that many ecosystems are likely to exist in alternative stable states, depending on their history, is relevant to the setting of restoration goals. A range of measures, such as those being developed to measure ecosystem health, could be used to develop {\textquotedblleft}scorecards{\textquotedblright} for restoration efforts. Generalizable guidelines for restoration on individual sites could be based on the concepts of designed disturbance, controlled colonization, and controlled species performance. Fewer explicit guidelines are available at the landscape scale, beyond nonquantitative generalities about size and connectivity. Development of these guidelines is an important priority so that urgent large-scale restoration can be planned and implemented effectively.},

	abstract = {Structural patterns of tall stands ({\textquotedblleft}tussock{\textquotedblright}) and short stands ({\textquotedblleft}lawn{\textquotedblright}) are observed in grazed vegetation throughout the world. Such structural vegetation diversity influences plant and animal diversity. A possible mechanism for the creation and preservation of such patterns is a positive feedback between grazing and plant palatability. Although some theoretical studies have addressed this point in a non-spatial setting, the spatial consequences of this feedback mechanism on the stability and spatial characteristics of vegetation structure patterns have not been studied.

We addressed this issue by analyzing a spatially explicit individual-based plant-grazer simulation model, based on published empirical relations and the assumption of optimal foraging.

In the model, the selection by the grazer of short stands (that have a higher energy content and are more palatable) is affected by traveling costs and the spatial organization of swards. Nevertheless, the most selected biomass in this type of short stands was the optimal biomass predicted by cropping and digestion constraints. As a result of the optimal foraging strategy, the grazers displayed L\'{e}vy-flight traveling behavior during the simulations with characteristic exponent $\mu$ ? 2.

Patterns of short and tall stands created by grazing were preserved for at least a decade. Even in seasonal habitat, the spatial organization of the patterns remained relatively constant, despite fluctuations in the area of short stands. Heterogeneity of initial vegetation increased heterogeneity of the grazing-induced pattern, but did not affect its stability.

The area of short stands that was preserved by grazing scaled with the herbivore mass to the power 0.4 and with the carrying capacity of the vegetation to the power -0.75.

Patterns of tall and short stands can be created and perpetuated by optimally grazing ruminants, irrespective of possible underlying soil patterns. The simulations generate predictions for the stability and spatial characteristics of such structural vegetation patterns.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of arid and semiarid grazing systems are prone to the effects of highly variable rainfall, with droughts causing frequent episodic mortality in herbivore populations. This has led to the suggestion that they are nonequilibrium systems, in which animal impacts on plants are strongly attenuated or absent. We examine the utility and appropriateness of nonequilibrium concepts for understanding ecosystem processes in African rangeland, attempt to distinguish disequilibrium from nonequilibrium, and argue that such concepts do not justify the view that herbivory has little impact in climatically variable systems. We present evidence for an alternative view of African rangeland function. We argue that, despite the apparent lack of equilibrium, animal numbers are regulated in a density-dependent manner by the limited forage available in key resource areas, which are utilized in the dry season. This model asserts that strong equilibrial forces exist over a limited part of the system, with the animal population being virtually uncoupled from resources elsewhere in the system. Spatially and temporally, the whole system is heterogeneous in the strength of the forces tending to equilibrium, these diminishing with distance from watering and key resource areas and during the wet season. We argue that wet-season range is more heavily utilized by animal populations sustained by key resource areas than would apply in the absence of key resources, and that uncoupling of the animal population from vegetation carries an increased risk of degradation. Droughts may impose intense and localized defoliation on vegetation, and this may result in altered species composition, reduced rain-use efficiency, soil erosion, and loss of productive potential. Rather than ignoring degradation, policy-makers and ecologists should seek to identify the characteristics of grazing systems that predispose some systems toward degradation, while others appear to be resistant. Development policies should focus on the spatial heterogeneity in susceptibility to grazing impacts and on preserving the productive capacity of key resource areas.},

	abstract = {* {1Rangeland} ecologists have been debating the validity of two current paradigms for the evaluation of vegetation dynamics on rangelands. This debate frequently contrasts the conventional model of continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics (range model) with a more contemporary model that can accommodate discontinuous and non-reversible vegetation change (state-and-transition model).
* {2The} range and the state-and-transition models are conceptually related to the equilibrium and non-equilibrium paradigms within ecology, respectively. The methodological dichotomy that has developed between the range and the state-and-transition models has fostered the perception that these two ecological paradigms are mutually exclusive. We challenge this perception and contend that both methodologies and their corresponding paradigms are non-exclusive.
* {3Equilibrium} and non-equilibrium ecosystems are not distinguished on the basis of unique processes or functions, but rather by the evaluation of system dynamics at various temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, ecosystems may express both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. This confirms early interpretations that ecosystems are distributed along a continuum from equilibrium to non-equilibrium states.
* {4Although} both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics occur in numerous ecosystems, the empirical evidence is frequently confounded by (i) uncertainty regarding the appropriate evidence necessary to distinguish between paradigms; (ii) disproportionate responses among vegetation attributes to climate and grazing; (iii) comparisons among systems with varying degrees of managerial involvement; and (iv) the evaluation of vegetation dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales.
* {5Synthesis} and applications. This critique supports the conclusion that a paradigm shift has not taken place in rangeland ecology, but rather, the debate has forced a more comprehensive interpretation of vegetation dynamics along the entirety of the equilibrium{\textendash}non-equilibrium continuum. Therefore, the rangeland debate should be redirected from the dichotomy between paradigms to one of paradigm integration.},

The practice of ecological restoration has been identified as providing ideal experimental settings for tests of ecological theory; restoration was to be the {\textquoteleft}acid test{\textquoteright} of our ecological understanding. Over the past decade, restoration science has gained a strong academic foothold, addressing problems faced by restoration practitioners, bringing new focus to existing ecological theory and fostering a handful of novel ecological ideas. In particular, recent advances in plant community ecology have been strongly linked with issues in ecological restoration. Evolving models of succession, assembly and state-transition are at the heart of both community ecology and ecological restoration. Recent research on seed and recruitment limitation, soil processes, and diversity{\textendash}function relationships also share strong links to restoration. Further opportunities may lie ahead in the ecology of plant ontogeny, and on the effects of contingency, such as year effects and priority effects. Ecology may inform current restoration practice, but there is considerable room for greater integration between academic scientists and restoration practitioners.},

Many conceptual state-and-transition models have been developed, however, the ecological interpretation of the model's primary components, states, transitions, and thresholds, has varied due to a lack of universally accepted definitions. The lack of consistency in definitions has led to confusion and criticism indicating the need for further development and refinement of the theory and associated models. We present an extensive review of current literature and conceptual models and point out the inconsistencies in the application of nonequilibrium ecology concepts. The importance of ecosystem stability as defined by the resistance and resilience of plant communities to disturbance is discussed as an important concept relative to state-and-transition modeling. Finally, we propose a set of concise definitions for state-and-transition model components and we present a conceptual model of state/transition/threshold relationships that are determined by the resilience and resistance of the ecosystems' primary ecological processes. This model provides a framework for development of process-based state-and-transition models for management and research. /// Los modelos de estados-y- transici\'{o}n presentan un gran potencial para ayudar a entender la respuesta de los ecosistemas de pastizal a los disturbios naturales y/o inducidos por el manejo al proveer una estructura para organizar el conocimiento presente de las din\'{a}micas del potencial del ecosistema.

	abstract = {Models predict that desertification, the loss of perennial grasses in arid and semiarid environments, will be difficult to reverse due to the positive feedback between plant cover and water infiltration; reductions in plant cover concurrently reduce water infiltration to a level that is insufficient for grass growth and recruitment. Thus, a desertified state becomes stable. However, these models cannot account for recently reported perennial grass recovery in desertified habitats. Here, we suggest a novel mechanism to explain these observations: the natural increase in water infiltration rate associated with recovery from livestock-induced soil compaction. We empirically evaluate this mechanism by comparing vegetation, water infiltration rates and soil compaction at three nearby, desertified livestock exclosures that differ in time since livestock removal and perennial grass recovery; the oldest exclosure (54 years) has experienced a significant increase in perennial grasses, while there has been no such increase at the two younger exclosures (25 and 10 years). Across sites, relative differences (inside compared to outside) in water infiltration rate and soil compaction increased across each grazing fence with time since livestock removal. The relative difference in soil compaction and relative difference in water infiltration rate were significantly greatest at the sole exclosure in which perennial grasses have recovered. These data support a key aspect of desertification models: the importance of water infiltration rate for resilience of vegetation in desertified systems. Although water infiltration rate plays a critical role in understanding the stability of desertified systems, theoretical models of desertification have only incorporated plant cover as the key mechanism affecting infiltration rate. Our work suggests soil compaction may also be an important mechanism.},

A new analytical model is developed to investigate this behavior and to study the effects of interannual rainfall variability on the dynamics of bistable ecosystems. When dichotomic Markov noise is used to account for the effect of random rainfall fluctuations, the long-term dynamics of the system can be investigated through an analytical solution of the model. It is found that in a broad class of bistable ecosystems, random rainfall fluctuations may induce an ordered state in the dynamics, i.e., by turning the bistable deterministic system into a stochastic system with only one statistically stable state. This effect is enhanced by increases in noise intensity, whereas the stochastic dynamics become bistable (i.e., the noise-induced ordered state disappears) as the noise intensity decreases below a critical (nonnull) value. This effect of noise-induced stability is found in association with an enhancement of ecosystem resilience, indicating that the likelihood of catastrophic shifts to the desert state decreases as the noise intensity increases.},

For fast-growing populations, these models show populations can persist at high levels of predation even though lower levels of predation lead to essential extinction.

In each of these cases, the mechanism behind these disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical threshold determined by the Allee effect.

In the absence of such knowledge, the recurrence of boom-bust cycles in livestock populations, along with the seemingly degraded state of semiarid range, have been used to support notions of the inevitability of overgrazing. Regional stocking rates are used as indicators of degradation potential. I argue that the persistent reliance by environmental analysts on carrying-capacity models oversimplifies range ecology and excludes social processes from causal analyses. Both regional stocking rates and the seasonality of livestock distributions should be treated as proximate factors, each affected by biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. The common assumption that the size of local livestock populations is primarily affected by bioclimatic factors results from a misunderstanding of the pastoral economy. A case study examines the underlying causes of the cattle population boom in the Maasina during the 1960s. Rather than being solely a biological phenomenon, growth in the Maasina cattle population resulted from the historical confluence of inoculation programs with greater local demand for covert accumulation brought about by the changing social relations between the Ful$\beta$ e and the Rimay$\beta$ e.},

Three complementary models are presented: the generation of a grass height structure through selective grazing; investigating the conditions for consumer coexistence; and, using a simplified resource structure, the consequences for consumer abundance. The main finding is that coexistence between grazers differing in body size is possible if a single-resource type becomes differentiated in its height structure. Large grazers can facilitate food availability for smaller species but with the latter being competitively dominant. The relative preference given to different resource partitions is important in determining the nature of population interactions. Large-body and small-body grazer populations can interact through competitive, parasitic, commensalist, or amensalist relationships, depending on the way they partition the resource as well as their relative populations and the dynamics of resource renewal. The models provide new concepts of multispecies carrying capacity (stock equilibrium) in grazed systems with implications for conservation and management. We conclude that consumer species are not substitutable; therefore, the use of rangeland management concepts such as {\textquotedblleft}livestock units{\textquotedblright} may be inappropriate.},

Range management under this model centres on carrying capacity, stocking rates and range condition assessment. In contrast, non-equilibrium rangeland systems are thought to be driven primarily by stochastic abiotic factors, notably variable rainfall, which result in highly variable and unpredictable primary production. Livestock populations are thought to have negligible feedback on the vegetation as their numbers rarely reach equilibrium with their fluctuating resource base. Recent studies suggest that most arid and semi-arid rangeland systems encompass elements of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium at different scales, and that management needs to take into account temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity.},

However, release from soil enemies does not explain all plant invasions. The invasion of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass or European beach grass) in California provides an illustrative example for which the enemy release hypothesis has been refuted. To explore the possible role of plant{\textendash}soil community interactions in this invasion, we developed a mathematical model. First, we analyzed the role of plant{\textendash}soil community interactions in the succession of A. arenaria in its native range (north-western Europe). Then, we used our model to explore for California how alternative plant{\textendash}soil community interactions may generate the same effect as if A. arenaria were released from soil enemies. This analysis was carried out by construction of a {\textquoteleft}recovery plane{\textquoteright} that discriminates between plant competition and plant{\textendash}soil community interactions. Our model shows that in California, the accumulation of local pathogens by A. arenaria could result in exclusion of native plant species. Moreover, this mechanism could trigger the rate and spatial pattern of invasive spread generally observed in nature. We propose that our {\textquoteleft}accumulation of local pathogens{\textquoteright} hypothesis could serve as an alternative explanation for the enemy release hypothesis to be considered in further experimental studies on invasive plant species.},

A model is developed which accounts for the growth of woody vegetation and of grasses, and analyses the competition between them for available soil water. (2) The model is based on Walter's two layer hypothesis. Woody vegetation and grasses compete for water in the surface layers of the soil, but woody vegetation has exclusive access to a source of water relatively deep underground. Where there is only a small biomass of grass the soil surface tends to become impermeable and, in these conditions, the model shows that two different steady states may develop: with a lot of woody vegetation alone, or with a relatively large biomass of grass and rather little woody vegetation. (3) The results are discussed in terms of the concept of resilience. The continued existence of both stable states under ranching conditions seems to depend on periodic heavy, or over-, grazing which allows for the maintenance of unpalatable or unstable grass species, which thus set a minimum to grass biomass--a minimum which cannot be reduced by herbivores. (4) Comparison of the dynamics of various savanna and other natural systems leads to the conclusion that the resilience of the systems decreases as their stability (usually induced) increases.},

They support the view that biased measurements of livestock productivity and inappropriate measurements of rangeland degradation can lead to under-estimates of the productivity of African communal rangelands, overestimates of the urgency of de-stocking, and misunderstanding of the strengths of measures required to effect it. By including the full range of livestock products in estimates of productivity and calculating output per unit of land area rather than per unit of livestock, more accurate estimates of productivity can be made. Estimates of degradation based on irreversible changes enable discrimination between trivial and important impacts of grazing. Modelling suggests de-stocking is not in general worthwhile at present in eastern Botswana. It may be necessary to regulate numbers of animals in the future. If livestock densities increase, grass cover could fall below the critical level and rates of degradation increase suddenly and rapidly. Adverse climatic change could reduce herbaceous productivity with the same effect. The approach used here should help decision making in those circumstaces. Choosing an appropriate stocking rate should be an ethical decision requiring negotiations among stakeholders. Practitioners should recognise that it is socially, not technically determined and that it is but one level among many possible densities.},

	abstract = {* {1Shrub} encroachment has been widely observed in savanna regions. This study analysed the causes of shrub encroachment in the lowveld savanna of north-eastern Swaziland, southern Africa, and highlighted management regimes that can be used to reduce or prevent it.
* {2The} rates and dynamics of shrub encroachment were quantified for the period 1947{\textendash}90 using aerial photographs, and for 1997 using a ground survey. Five similar areas with different land-use histories were compared to investigate the relative importance of fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil type and shrub density in driving shrub dynamics.
* {3In} the study area as a whole, shrub cover increased from a mean of 2\% in 1947 to 31\% in 1990. Dichrostachys cinerea accounted for most of the increase in cover, contributing 81\% to total shrub cover during 1997. Shrub cover was strongly correlated with shrub density and weakly negatively correlated with tree cover.
* {4Shrub} encroachment varied across land-use fence lines. The key determinants of shrub dynamics were grazing, through its negative effect on fire frequency and an interaction between drought frequency and high shrub cover. Browsing pressure had a significant but minor impact on dynamics, while soil type had no significant effect. High grazing pressures through their effect on fire frequency were critical throughout the study period in promoting shrub encroachment, while the interaction between drought and high shrub cover produced declines in the later stages. Browsing had an impact on encroachment only in the early stages.
* {5Frequent} fires, facilitated by low grazing pressures, were capable of preventing shrub encroachment. When coupled with drought, frequent fires could reduce high shrub densities.
* {6As} cover and density were strongly correlated, it can be inferred from the negative correlation between change in cover (density) and initial cover (density) that the rate of shrub encroachment was cover (density)-dependent and that there was a shrub equilibrium of 40\% cover, approximating to 2400 plants ha-1. Shrub population growth was driven by events (fire, drought) as well as continuous agents (density dependence, mean browsing and grazing pressure).
* {7Bush} encroachment can be reversed by a combination of management (frequent fires) and climatic events (drought). The implications for savanna management are discussed.},

	abstract = {What is overgrazing? Does it cause soil erosion? The recent debate from the ecological literature is reviewed as background to the debate on overgrazing and soil erosion. This debate stresses the need to view dryland grazing systems as dynamic ecosystems driven more by rainfall events than by livestock numbers. The case for soil erosion is then examined. Two case studies from communal rangelands in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, have cast doubts on the conventional wisdom that overgrazing leads to soil erosion. The first, a study of historical land-use change and erosion in a communal area, showed that the most intense erosion, taking the form of steeply dissected badlands, was associated with cultivated land that had been abandoned and reverted to grazing from the 1960s onwards. Such severe erosion was generally absent from land that had been under grazing since the 1930s. The second study demonstrated that erosion rates from communal grazing lands ({\textquoteleft}overgrazed{\textquoteright}) were only slightly higher than those from land under {\textquoteleft}optimal{\textquoteright} grazing, that is grazing at a level considered not to exceed the carrying capacity of the land. These results support the ecologist's contention that communal grazing systems do not necessarily degrade the range condition relative to management systems based on a notional carrying capacity.

This paper is an attempt to move beyond polarization of the current debate towards a more integrative and flexible approach to grazing management. We propose five different conditions as major influences on grazing regimes: environmental variability and predictability; degradation and thresholds; property right regimes; discount rates; and market stability and prices. We suggest a lack of connection between the micro-economics literature and natural science and social-anthropological literature. It is timely to achieve greater integration around some key questions and hypotheses, and recognize that policy prescriptions at national or even regional levels are likely to have limited value due to context specificity.},

Often, fragmentation results from actions that are intended to enhance human livelihoods and well-being; however, there are often costs to ecosystems and human economies that are not considered. We describe the three general categories of processes causing fragmentation of rangelands worldwide: dissection, decoupling, and compression. We show that access to heterogeneity of landscapes is an important attribute of grazing ecosystems worldwide, and that fragmentation of these systems, even when it proceeds in the absence of habitat loss, can limit options of people and animals, options that are particularly important in temporally heterogeneous environments. We discuss the consequences of fragmentation for people, livestock, wildlife, and landscapes and describe potential adaptations that can mitigate its harmful outcomes. We close by reviewing policy options that promote re-aggregation of landscapes and adaptation to fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Herbivores are regulated by predation under certain environmental conditions, whereas under others they are limited by forage abundance and nutritional quality. Whether top-down or bottom-up regulation prevails depends both on abiotic constraints on forage availability and body size, because size simultaneously affects the risk of predation of herbivores and their nutritional demands. Consequently, ecosystems composed of similar species can have different dynamics if they differ in resource supply. Here, we use large herbivore assemblages in African savanna ecosystems to develop a framework that connects environmental gradients and disturbance patterns with body size and trophic structure. This framework provides a model for understanding the functioning and diversity of ecosystems in general, and unifies how top-down and bottom-up mechanisms depend on common underlying environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {State-and-transition models are increasingly being used to guide rangeland management. These models provide a relatively simple, management-oriented way to classify land condition (state) and to describe the factors that might cause a shift to another state (a transition). There are many formulations of state-and-transition models in the literature. The version we endorse does not adhere to any particular generalities about ecosystem dynamics, but it includes consideration of several kinds of dynamics and management response to them. In contrast to previous uses of state-and-transition models, we propose that models can, at present, be most effectively used to specify and qualitatively compare the relative benefits and potential risks of different management actions (e.g., fire and grazing) and other factors (e.g., invasive species and climate change) on specified areas of land. High spatial and temporal variability and complex interactions preclude the meaningful use of general quantitative models. Forecasts can be made on a case-by-case basis by interpreting qualitative and quantitative indicators, historical data, and spatially structured monitoring data based on conceptual models. We illustrate how science- based conceptual models are created using several rangeland examples that vary in complexity. In doing so, we illustrate the implications of designating plant communities and states in models, accounting for varying scales of pattern in vegetation and soils, interpreting the presence of plant communities on different soils and dealing with our uncertainty about how those communities were assembled and how they will change in the future. We conclude with observations about how models have helped to improve management decision-making.},

Consequently, inappropriate policies, stressing the need to destock and stabilise the rangelands, are pursued. Acknowledgement of the great instability but intrinsic resilience of rangeland would encourage the Governments to more favourably regard the opportunistic stocking strategies of the agro-pastoralists of the Communal Areas. However, degradation of rangelands is occurring, although at varying rates. This justifies the promotion of a {\textquoteleft}tracking strategy{\textquoteright}, in which livestock densities are encouraged to follow, more closely that at present, variations in rainfall. The establishment of grazing territories controlled by specific {\textquoteleft}communities{\textquoteright} may be a prerequisite for the promotion of the tracking strategy, and for communal rangeland management and improvement. However, the establishment of such territories must take into account social equity, institutional problems and transaction costs, as well as spatial and temporal variation in rangeland resources.},
