	abstract = {This article synthesizes the ecological concepts and perspectives underpinning the development and application of state-and-transition models, thresholds, and rangeland health. Introduction of the multiple stable state concept paved the way for the development of these alternative evaluation procedures by hypothesizing that multiple stable plant communities can potentially occupy individual ecological sites. Vegetation evaluation procedures must be able to assess continuous and reversible as well as discontinuous and nonreversible vegetation dynamics because both patterns occur and neither pattern alone provides a complete assessment of vegetation dynamics on all rangelands. Continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics prevail within stable vegetation states, whereas discontinuous and nonreversible dynamics occur when thresholds are surpassed and one stable state replaces another. State-and-transition models can accommodate both categories of vegetation dynamics because they represent vegetation change along several axes, including fire regimes, weather variability, and management prescriptions, in addition to the succession-grazing axis associated with the traditional range model. Ecological thresholds have become a focal point of state-and-transition models because threshold identification is necessary for recognition of the various stable plant communities than can potentially occupy an ecological site. Thresholds are difficult to define and quantify because they represent a complex series of interacting components, rather than discrete boundaries in time and space. Threshold components can be categorized broadly as structural and functional based on compositional and spatial vegetation attributes, and on modification of ecosystem processes, respectively. State-and-transition models and rangeland health procedures have developed in parallel, rather than as components of an integrated framework, because the two procedures primarily rely on structural and functional thresholds, respectively. It may be prudent for rangeland professionals to consider the introduction of these alternative evaluation procedures as the beginning of a long-term developmental process, rather than as an end point marked by the adoption of an alternative set of standardized evaluation procedures. /// Este art\'{i}culo sintetiza los conceptos ecol\'{o}gicos y perspectivas en las que se fundamenta el desarrollo y aplicaci\'{o}n de los modelos de estado- y- transici\'{o}n, umbrales y salud del pastizal. La introducci\'{o}n del concepto de m\'{u}ltiples estados estables estableci\'{o} el camino para el desarrollo de estos procedimientos alternativos de evaluaci\'{o}n, hipotetizando que m\'{u}ltiples comunidades estables de plantas puede potencialmente ocupar sitios ecol\'{o}gicos individuales. Los procedimientos de evaluaci\'{o}n de la vegetaci\'{o}n deben ser capaces de evaluar tanto las din\'{a}micas de vegetaci\'{o}n continuas y reversibles como las discontinuas y no reversibles, ya que ambos patrones ocurren y ning\'{u}n patr\'{o}n solo provee una evaluaci\'{o}n completa de las din\'{a}micas de la vegetaci\'{o}n en todos los pastizales. Las din\'{a}micas de la vegetaci\'{o}n continuas y reversibles prevalecen dentro de los estados estables de la vegetaci\'{o}n mientras que las discontinuas y no reversibles ocurren cuando los umbrales son sobrepasados y un estado estable remplaza a otro. Los modelos de estados- y- transici\'{o}n pueden acomodar ambas categor\'{i}as de din\'{a}micas de la vegetaci\'{o}n porque ellos representan el cambio de la vegetaci\'{o}n a lo largo de varios ejes, incluyendo reg\'{i}menes de fuego, variabilidad clim\'{a}tica y prescripciones de manejo; adem\'{a}s del eje de sucesi\'{o}n-apacentamiento asociado con el modelo tradicional del pastizal. Los umbrales ecol\'{o}gicos han venido a ser un punto central de los modelos de estado- y- transici\'{o}n, porque la identificaci\'{o}n de estos umbrales es necesaria para reconocer las diferentes comunidades vegetales estables que potencialmente pueden ocupar un sitio ecol\'{o}gico. Los umbrales son dif\'{i}ciles de definir y cuantificar porque ellos representan una serie compleja de componentes interactuando en lugar de fronteras discretas en tiempo y espacio. Los componentes de los umbrales pueden ser ampliamente categorizados como estructurales y funcionales en base a los atributos de composicionales y espaciales de la vegetaci\'{o}n y en la modificaci\'{o}n de los procesos de los ecosistemas respectivamente. Los modelos de estados y- transici\'{o}n y los procedimientos de salud del pastizal se han desarrollado paralelamente en lugar de desarrollarse como componentes de una estructura integrada porque los dos procedimientos se basan principalmente en umbrales estructurales y funcionales respectivamente. Pude ser prudente para la profesi\'{o}n de manejo de pastizales considerar la introducci\'{o}n de estas procedimientos alternativos de evaluaci\'{o}n como el inicio de un proceso de desarrollo a largo plazo, en lugar de un punto final marcado por la adopci\'{o}n de un grupo alternativo de procedimientos estandarizados de evaluaci\'{o}n.},

	abstract = {(1) Differences in plant species' abundances in response to cattle grazing and protection were measured across fences at fifteen sites in productive semi-natural mediterranean grasslands. The results were tested for the consistency of species' responses to grazing intensity and for their association with plant attributes expected to be involved in the grazing response. (2) Of the seventy-three most common species, forty-nine showed responses that were largely consistent over sites, being either significantly more abundant on the more protected side, significantly more abundant on the more grazed side, or not significantly different. The remaining twenty-four species were inconsistent, being significantly more abundant on the protected side in some sites and on the grazed side in others. (3) Of the inconsistent species, fourteen showed a pattern of responses over sites that could be explained by a unimodal response to grazing intensity, with an optimum at intensities between the extremes of complete protection and very heavy continuous grazing represented in the study. (4) Species response to grazing was not significantly associated with family, which inferred chemical palatability, nor with spininess. (5) Perennial species with long growing seasons were somewhat more frequent among protection increasers, and their total cover greater in protected grassland. (6) Grazing response was strongly and significantly associated with plant growth form: protection increasers were mostly tall erect plants; grazing increasers mostly small, prostrate or rosette plants; and species with intermediate response mostly erect plants of medium height. (7) Ungrazed grassland was dominated (60-80\% cover) by tall perennials and tall, annual grasses. Under light to moderate grazing their cover decreased to the benefit of annuals of a wide range of growth forms and families; of those, under heavy grazing, small and prostrate annuals, rosette crucifers and thistles remained abundant. (8) The observed responses to grazing from none to light and moderate intensity can be explained best by the opening of establishment gaps in the closed sward of foliage and mulch maintained by the dominants. At moderate to heavy grazing the vertical differential defoliation gradient imposed by cattle, particularly early in the growing season, becomes the major mechanism of grassland change.*},

	abstract = {Heightening human impacts on the Earth result in widespread losses of production and conservation values and make large-scale ecosystem restoration increasingly urgent. Tackling this problem requires the development of general guiding principles for restoration so that we can move away from the ad hoc, site- and situation-specific approach that now prevails. A continuum of restoration efforts can be recognized, ranging from restoration of localized highly degraded sites to restoration of entire landscapes for production and/or conservation reasons. We emphasize the importance of developing restoration methodologies that are applicable at the landscape scale. Key processes in restoration include identifying and dealing with the processes leading to degradation in the first place, determining realistic goals and measures of success, developing methods for implementing the goals and incorporating them into land-management and planning strategies, and monitoring the restoration and assessing its success. Few of these procedures are currently incorporated in many restoration projects. The concept that many ecosystems are likely to exist in alternative stable states, depending on their history, is relevant to the setting of restoration goals. A range of measures, such as those being developed to measure ecosystem health, could be used to develop {\textquotedblleft}scorecards{\textquotedblright} for restoration efforts. Generalizable guidelines for restoration on individual sites could be based on the concepts of designed disturbance, controlled colonization, and controlled species performance. Fewer explicit guidelines are available at the landscape scale, beyond nonquantitative generalities about size and connectivity. Development of these guidelines is an important priority so that urgent large-scale restoration can be planned and implemented effectively.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of arid and semiarid grazing systems are prone to the effects of highly variable rainfall, with droughts causing frequent episodic mortality in herbivore populations. This has led to the suggestion that they are nonequilibrium systems, in which animal impacts on plants are strongly attenuated or absent. We examine the utility and appropriateness of nonequilibrium concepts for understanding ecosystem processes in African rangeland, attempt to distinguish disequilibrium from nonequilibrium, and argue that such concepts do not justify the view that herbivory has little impact in climatically variable systems. We present evidence for an alternative view of African rangeland function. We argue that, despite the apparent lack of equilibrium, animal numbers are regulated in a density-dependent manner by the limited forage available in key resource areas, which are utilized in the dry season. This model asserts that strong equilibrial forces exist over a limited part of the system, with the animal population being virtually uncoupled from resources elsewhere in the system. Spatially and temporally, the whole system is heterogeneous in the strength of the forces tending to equilibrium, these diminishing with distance from watering and key resource areas and during the wet season. We argue that wet-season range is more heavily utilized by animal populations sustained by key resource areas than would apply in the absence of key resources, and that uncoupling of the animal population from vegetation carries an increased risk of degradation. Droughts may impose intense and localized defoliation on vegetation, and this may result in altered species composition, reduced rain-use efficiency, soil erosion, and loss of productive potential. Rather than ignoring degradation, policy-makers and ecologists should seek to identify the characteristics of grazing systems that predispose some systems toward degradation, while others appear to be resistant. Development policies should focus on the spatial heterogeneity in susceptibility to grazing impacts and on preserving the productive capacity of key resource areas.},

	abstract = {* {1Rangeland} ecologists have been debating the validity of two current paradigms for the evaluation of vegetation dynamics on rangelands. This debate frequently contrasts the conventional model of continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics (range model) with a more contemporary model that can accommodate discontinuous and non-reversible vegetation change (state-and-transition model).
* {2The} range and the state-and-transition models are conceptually related to the equilibrium and non-equilibrium paradigms within ecology, respectively. The methodological dichotomy that has developed between the range and the state-and-transition models has fostered the perception that these two ecological paradigms are mutually exclusive. We challenge this perception and contend that both methodologies and their corresponding paradigms are non-exclusive.
* {3Equilibrium} and non-equilibrium ecosystems are not distinguished on the basis of unique processes or functions, but rather by the evaluation of system dynamics at various temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, ecosystems may express both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. This confirms early interpretations that ecosystems are distributed along a continuum from equilibrium to non-equilibrium states.
* {4Although} both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics occur in numerous ecosystems, the empirical evidence is frequently confounded by (i) uncertainty regarding the appropriate evidence necessary to distinguish between paradigms; (ii) disproportionate responses among vegetation attributes to climate and grazing; (iii) comparisons among systems with varying degrees of managerial involvement; and (iv) the evaluation of vegetation dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales.
* {5Synthesis} and applications. This critique supports the conclusion that a paradigm shift has not taken place in rangeland ecology, but rather, the debate has forced a more comprehensive interpretation of vegetation dynamics along the entirety of the equilibrium{\textendash}non-equilibrium continuum. Therefore, the rangeland debate should be redirected from the dichotomy between paradigms to one of paradigm integration.},

Many conceptual state-and-transition models have been developed, however, the ecological interpretation of the model's primary components, states, transitions, and thresholds, has varied due to a lack of universally accepted definitions. The lack of consistency in definitions has led to confusion and criticism indicating the need for further development and refinement of the theory and associated models. We present an extensive review of current literature and conceptual models and point out the inconsistencies in the application of nonequilibrium ecology concepts. The importance of ecosystem stability as defined by the resistance and resilience of plant communities to disturbance is discussed as an important concept relative to state-and-transition modeling. Finally, we propose a set of concise definitions for state-and-transition model components and we present a conceptual model of state/transition/threshold relationships that are determined by the resilience and resistance of the ecosystems' primary ecological processes. This model provides a framework for development of process-based state-and-transition models for management and research. /// Los modelos de estados-y- transici\'{o}n presentan un gran potencial para ayudar a entender la respuesta de los ecosistemas de pastizal a los disturbios naturales y/o inducidos por el manejo al proveer una estructura para organizar el conocimiento presente de las din\'{a}micas del potencial del ecosistema.

Ecosystem regimes that are obvious at one scale may not be at another.

	abstract = {A simple mathematical model has been formulated to model a simple rotational grazing system of two fields, where a mob of animals is grazed first in one field, then the other.

By using linear functions for the rate of herbage mass accumulation and for the rate of animal herbage intake, this system may be solved explicitly to yield expressions for (1) the total intake per animal over the time period, and (2) the total remaining herbage after grazing.

Regarding the swap over time as an optimal control variable, these expressions can be optimized. The results are analysed for various initial conditions, including stocking rate, initial biomass in each field, and field

Comparisons are made with continuous grazing. Extensions to the model are discussed.},

	abstract = {Models predict that desertification, the loss of perennial grasses in arid and semiarid environments, will be difficult to reverse due to the positive feedback between plant cover and water infiltration; reductions in plant cover concurrently reduce water infiltration to a level that is insufficient for grass growth and recruitment. Thus, a desertified state becomes stable. However, these models cannot account for recently reported perennial grass recovery in desertified habitats. Here, we suggest a novel mechanism to explain these observations: the natural increase in water infiltration rate associated with recovery from livestock-induced soil compaction. We empirically evaluate this mechanism by comparing vegetation, water infiltration rates and soil compaction at three nearby, desertified livestock exclosures that differ in time since livestock removal and perennial grass recovery; the oldest exclosure (54 years) has experienced a significant increase in perennial grasses, while there has been no such increase at the two younger exclosures (25 and 10 years). Across sites, relative differences (inside compared to outside) in water infiltration rate and soil compaction increased across each grazing fence with time since livestock removal. The relative difference in soil compaction and relative difference in water infiltration rate were significantly greatest at the sole exclosure in which perennial grasses have recovered. These data support a key aspect of desertification models: the importance of water infiltration rate for resilience of vegetation in desertified systems. Although water infiltration rate plays a critical role in understanding the stability of desertified systems, theoretical models of desertification have only incorporated plant cover as the key mechanism affecting infiltration rate. Our work suggests soil compaction may also be an important mechanism.},

	abstract = {Positive feedbacks between vegetation and soil moisture may induce, in arid ecosystems, the emergence of two alternative stable states, corresponding to bare and completely vegetated soil. A new analytical model is developed to investigate this behavior and to study the effects of interannual rainfall variability on the dynamics of bistable ecosystems. When dichotomic Markov noise is used to account for the effect of random rainfall fluctuations, the long-term dynamics of the system can be investigated through an analytical solution of the model. It is found that in a broad class of bistable ecosystems, random rainfall fluctuations may induce an ordered state in the dynamics, i.e., by turning the bistable deterministic system into a stochastic system with only one statistically stable state. This effect is enhanced by increases in noise intensity, whereas the stochastic dynamics become bistable (i.e., the noise-induced ordered state disappears) as the noise intensity decreases below a critical (nonnull) value. This effect of noise-induced stability is found in association with an enhancement of ecosystem resilience, indicating that the likelihood of catastrophic shifts to the desert state decreases as the noise intensity increases.},

	abstract = {Discrete time single species models with overcompensating density dependence and an Allee effect due to predator satiation and mating limitation are investigated. The models exhibit four behaviors: persistence for all initial population densities, bistability in which a population persists for intermediate initial densities and otherwise goes extinct, extinction for all initial densities, and essential extinction in which {\textquotedblleft}almost every{\textquotedblright} initial density leads to extinction. For fast-growing populations, these models show populations can persist at high levels of predation even though lower levels of predation lead to essential extinction. Alternatively, increasing the predator's handling time, the population's carrying capacity, or the likelihood of mating success may lead to essential extinction. In each of these cases, the mechanism behind these disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical threshold determined by the Allee effect. These disappearances are proceeded by chaotic transients that are proven to be approximately exponentially distributed in length and highly sensitive to initial population densities.},

	abstract = {There has been little experimental work in West Africa that distinguishes grazing from climate effects on rangeland vegetation. In the absence of such knowledge, the recurrence of boom-bust cycles in livestock populations, along with the seemingly degraded state of semiarid range, have been used to support notions of the inevitability of overgrazing. Regional stocking rates are used as indicators of degradation potential. I argue that the persistent reliance by environmental analysts on carrying-capacity models oversimplifies range ecology and excludes social processes from causal analyses. Both regional stocking rates and the seasonality of livestock distributions should be treated as proximate factors, each affected by biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. The common assumption that the size of local livestock populations is primarily affected by bioclimatic factors results from a misunderstanding of the pastoral economy. A case study examines the underlying causes of the cattle population boom in the Maasina during the 1960s. Rather than being solely a biological phenomenon, growth in the Maasina cattle population resulted from the historical confluence of inoculation programs with greater local demand for covert accumulation brought about by the changing social relations between the Ful$\beta$ e and the Rimay$\beta$ e.},
